Code (main.py) for recording data from a grid with NTC velocity sensors and temperature sensors.
To increase measurement resolution (for quasi-steady flow), a translation stage is used. The Arduino code (Arduino_code_for_Table_up_down_Ultrasonic_Sensor.ino) is also attached. It is tested on Arduino Uno.
To run both the velocity measurement of the grid and the Arduino run (main_and_translation_stage.py). 
Setting like waiting time and recording time may have to be changed in the Arduino_code_for_Table_up_down_Ultrasonic_Sensor.ino and the main_and_translation_stage.py code.
